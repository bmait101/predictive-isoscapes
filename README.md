# Predictive Isoscapes

Mixing models that use stable isotope data are a powerful tool for examining animal diets and inferring trophic structure in ecological communities 

But numerous factors and assumptions (e.g., a large number of potential prey and variation or correlation among isotopic signatures of prey) can lead to erroneous interpretations of model results. 

Therefore novel approaches are needed to infer diet and trophic structure; in particular one which moves away from an *a posteriori** approach and instead focuses on an *a priori*, NULL model approach that allows for examining multiple competing mechanistic hypotheses. That is what this project seeks to develop.
